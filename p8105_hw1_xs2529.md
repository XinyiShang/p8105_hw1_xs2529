# Problem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)

data("early_january_weather")
```

The variables in the *early_january_weather* are origin, year, month,
day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib, time_hour.

This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.

The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

<br>

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color= humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_xs2529_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave(filename = "temperature and humidity over time.png")
```

The overall trend of the temperature is that it increases as time
passes, while fluctuations are observed between date. The humid level
does not show a trend. Around January 12th, a high humid level occured.

# Problem 2

``` r
df <- tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = samp>0,
  vec_char = c("a","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k"),
  vec_factor = factor(c(1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3), levels = c(1,2,3))
)

col_1 = pull(df,var = samp)
col_2 = pull(df,var = vec_logical)
col_3 = pull(df,var = vec_char)
col_4 = pull(df,var = vec_factor)

print(df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4

The mean of the ramdom sample (column 1) is 0.0389294.

The mean of the logical vector (column 2) is 0.6.

The mean of the character vector (column 3) is NA.

The mean of the factor vector (column 4) is NA.

The mean for the character vector and the factor vector does not work
because they are not numeric values.

``` r
col_2 = as.numeric(col_2)
col_3 = as.numeric(col_3)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
col_4 = as.numeric(col_4)
```

After applied the `as.numeric` function to logical, character, and
factor variable, the means becomes:

The mean of the logical vector (column 2) is 0.6.

The mean of the character vector (column 3) is NA.

The mean of the factor vector (column 4) is 2.3.

The result shows that the mean of the character vector and factor vector
were unable to calculate because they are not numeric values. After
convert to numeric value, the mean of the factor vector can be
calculated. However, the mean of the character vector still cannot be
calculated because they are letters and cannot be changed to numeric
value by `as.numeric`.
